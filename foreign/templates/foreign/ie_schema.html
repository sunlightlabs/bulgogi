    <h3>Foreign Influence Explorer Schema</h3>
    <p>
        The foreign influence database accessed via the Sunlight Foundation's Influence Explorer is updated with a data entry process using the Department of Justice' Foreign Agents Registration Act records. Downloads are updated daily. It should be noted, however, that not all documents submitted to the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act have been processed by us. Currently, users of our site can access all of the records submitted in 2013. A portion of the documents submitted in 2011 and 2012 have been processed by us and are available on our site. We are working hard to standardize and make available for browsing and download as many documents as we can. Information is available if you would like to <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/10/11/volunteer-watchdogs-wanted-help-us-track-foreign-influence/">learn how to contribute to this project</a>.
