			Methodology
		</h3>

		<p>
			The foreign influence database accessed via the Sunlight Foundation's Influence Explorer is updated both by hand and via automatic document feeds from the Department of Justice and other federal agencies on a regular basis. As soon as the data is structured we update the website and make the data available for download. Downloads are updated daily. It should be noted, however, that not all documents submitted to the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act have been processed by us. Currently, users of our site can access all of the records submitted in 2013. A portion of the documents submitted in 2011 and 2012 have been processed by us and are available on our site. We are working hard to standardize and make available for browsing and download as many documents as we can. Information is available if you would like to  <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/10/11/volunteer-watchdogs-wanted-help-us-track-foreign-influence/">learn how to contribute to this project.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			 Archival data from ForeignLobbying.org, the previous iteration of this project is available on this site for download and searching. ForignLobbying.org was a partnership between the Sunlight Foundation and ProPublica. The data range for this data is 2008-2011.

		<h4>
			Document types:
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			<b>Supplemental-</b> This document tells people what exact type of activity a registrant partakes in for its clients. For instance, a lobbying firm can contact a politician or a federal agency and a public relations firm might do media outreach or put together a conference and the activity is reported on this form.  "Supplemental" forms also contain key information such as who registrants have contacted in the United States, payments to registrants from clients, political contributions and disbursements that are used to pay for expenses and activities. These forms are filed every six months. In one year, registrants will fill to "Supplementals" with the DOJ. 		</p>
		<p>
	        <b>Registration-</b> This form is filed by new registrants. It includes much of the same key information that the Supplemental forms do: payments to registrants, political contributions and disbursements for expenses and activities. "Registration" forms are filed every six months.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>AB-</b> The "AB" forms are two forms that a registrant must file when it acquires new clients. They include information about the client, describe the work that the registrant expects to do. They also include a copy of the agreement.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Amendment-</b> This document contains corrections or changes to other forms.
		</p>	
		
		<p>
			Other document types include "Short Form Registrations" for individuals representing foreign agents, "Fundraising Forms" and "Articles of Incorporation". These form types aren't incorporated into Sunlight's database. For more information about FARA forms go the <a href="http://www.fara.gov/search.html">FARA website</a>.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>
			How it works:
		</h4>
		<p>
			The data in the Foreign Influence database comes from the Department of Justice's website. We selectively gather only the documents we're interested in using software written solely for this purpose. We structure and standardize the selected data by hand. The data is then entered into our database by a team of Sunlight employees, interns and volunteers. To ease fact-checking, we also insert a link to the original form on the DOJ's website for each hand-entered line item. The end product of this process helps users uncover influential relationships between U.S. policy makers and foreign enitities.

	    Foreign Agents Registration Act Spreadsheet Guide and Dictionary
	</h3>
	<p>
	    This data is a hand-entered, structured and normalized version of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) files found in PDF format at<a href="http://www.fara.gov/">
	    http://www.fara.gov/</a>. You can use Excel or any spreadsheet reader to access them, making it possible to easily search and analyze the information in
	    ways that the PDF format precludes.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Below is a brief description of the information included in the spreadsheets and a few key definitions to help you navigate the files.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	    The "Foreign Agent" also called, the "Registrant", is the individual or organization enlisted to represent a foreign interest in the United States. These individuals or entities are sometimes,
	    but not always, lobbyists. They can also be public relations firms, tourism organizations or business associations, among other things.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The "Client" is the foreign interest being represented. Sometimes foreign entities can represent themselves. In those cases the client and the lobbyist are the same entity in the data.
	</p>
	<p>
    Most dates are directly transcribed from FARA documents. In some instances we have to add or manipulate dates for the sake of uniformity in our database. For instance, if no date was given for a filing, we assign  the end date of the six-month reporting period during which it was submitted to the DOJ. Filings like that are indentified with an asterisk. If the month was provided in a filing, but not the day, we display the filing with the first day of the month as the date in our database. If a filing reports a date range instead of a single date, we select the first date of the range to represent the filing. To find out what date was actually reported, use the links to original filings that are provided on the site.</p>
	<h3>
	    CONTACTS:
	</h3>
	<p>
    This data contains descriptions of people and entities contacted by registrants in the data, press releases on behalf of foreign clients, meetings between foreign actors and people in the United States, conferences, speeches and other activity reported in the FARA forms.
    </p>
    <p>
    This information is among the most valuable information that can be obtained via the FARA because it identifies parties involved on both sides of meetings. And unlike lobbyists who represent domestic clients, representatives of foreign clients must name lawmakers, staff members and even journalists whom they met with on behalf of their clients.
    </p>
	<h4>
	    Explanation of Contact fields:
	</h4>
	<p>
	    'Date', The date of contact.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Contact Title', The title of the person contacted. (Note: this may change over time.)
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Contact Name', The name of the person contacted.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Contact Office', The office for which the person contacted works.	</p>
    <p>
     'Contact Agency', The agency or category of the contact, such as White House or Media.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Client', The client represented by the registrant, which can be the same as the registrant.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Client Location', The client's self-identified home base&mdash;this not always an officially recognized state.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Registrant', The person or organization that is filing, also known as the the foreign agent.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Description', A summary of the contact (give example), if provided.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Type', This describes the nature of the contact in certain broad categories, such as phone, email, meeting, other or unknown.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Employees Mentioned', Individuals associated with the registrant who were mentioned in the contact summary
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Affiliated Member CRP ID', This is the unique identifier issued to members of Congress by the Center for Responsive Politics and would be used to identify
	    contacts with that member as well as with his or her staff.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Affiliated Member Bioguide ID', This is the unique identifier issued to members of Congress by the government and would be used to identify contacts with
	    that member as well as with his or her staff.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Source', Link to original document.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Contact ID', An id for each person or organization contacted.
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Record ID', An id for each contact record.
	</p>

	<h3>
	    CONTRIBUTIONS
	</h3>
	<p>
    Though foreign donations are barred from federal elections, U.S. citizens and organizations that represent foreign interests in the U.S. may still contribute to candidates and campaigns. Therefore any registrant with forign clients that makes political contribuitons in the U.S. must report those campaign contributions to the Department of Justice according to FARA. This is in addition to disclosure requirements set forth by the Federal Election Commission.  		</p>
    <p>
    Note: Contribution amounts will likely NOT match records available at the Federal Election Commission, or those housed by the Sunlight Foundation's Influence Explorer and on OpenSecrets.org. Differences in reporting requirements between the FEC and the DOJ account for differences in amounts reported as well as different contribution dates. 	</p>
    <p>
    Again, FARA proves to be more reliable than the same information for domestic clients: Identifying political givers who might also be lobbyists and aggregating their giving over time requires difficult name matching and entity resolution processes. The reporting requirements for FARA documents eliminate that problem for situations that involve foreign clients. This attribute is key because it allow users to easily and reliably determine if registrants in the FARA database make campaign contributions to the same political offices that they are contacting on behalf of a foreign client&mdash;a common practice highlighted by this data.
