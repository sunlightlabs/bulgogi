			Methodology
		</h3>

		<p>
			The good news about this database is that it is continuously updated and as we structure the data, we update the website instantly and downloads are updated daily. However, please note that all the documents have not been precessed. The documents received by the Department of Justice in 2013 are complete. Many records from late 2011 and 2012 have not been standardized into the downloadable data sets. <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/10/11/volunteer-watchdogs-wanted-help-us-track-foreign-influence/">Learn how you can contribute to this project.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			 Archival data from ForeignLobbying.org, the previous iteration of this project is available here for download and searching. ForignLobbying.org was a partnership between the Sunlight Foundation and ProPublica. This data ranges from 2008-2011.

		<h4>
			Document types:
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			<b>Supplemental-</b> This document provides the type of public relations or lobbying a firm engages in on behalf of a foreign entity. For instance, a lobbying firm can lobby on the state or federal level and a public relations firm might do media outreach or put together a conference for a foreign client. This document helps people figure out what exact type of activity a registrant partakes in for its clients. "Supplemental" forms also contain key information such as who registrants have contacted in the United States, payments to registrants from clients, political contributions and disbursements that are used to pay for expenses and activities. These forms are filed every six months.To total a years worth of records, two "Supplemental" filings.
		</p>
		<p>
	        <b>Registration-</b> This document is the form filed by a new registrant. It includes much of the same key information that the "Supplemental" forms do: payments to registrants, political contributions and disbursements for expenses and activities. "Registration" forms are filed every six months.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>AB-</b> These are two forms that a registrant must file when it gets a new client to represent. They include information about the client, describe the work that the registrant expects to do and the include a copy of the agreement.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Amendment-</b> This document contains corrections or changes to other forms.
		</p>	
		
		<p>
			Other document types include "Short Form Registrations" for individuals representing foreign agents, "Fundraising Forms" and "Articles of Incorporation". Sunlight does not provide this list of form types for downloadable, but they are available on the <a href="http://www.fara.gov/search.html">FARA website</a>.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>
			How it works:
		</h4>
		<p>
			The structured data is created by crawling the Department of Justice's website for documents we are interested in. The data is then structured and standardized by hand followed by a team of sunlight employees, interns and volunteers entering the data into web forms. Each line item contains a link to the original form for easy fact-checking and verification. The end product of this process is a series of spreadsheets describing people and entitues contacted in the United States, political contributions from registrants, payments from clients to registrants and  registrants' disbursements for activities and expenses.
		</p>
		<p>
			CONTACTS
		</p>
		<p>	 
			This data contains descriptions of people and entities contacted by lobbyists in the data, press releases on behalf of foreign clients, meetings between foreign actors and people in the United States, conferences, speeches and other activity reported in the FARA forms.
		</p>
		<p>	
			This information is among the most valuable information that can be obtained via the FARA documents because unlike lobbyists who represent domestic clients, representatives of foreign interests must name lawmakers, staff members and even journalists whom they meet with on behalf of their clients.
		</p>
		<p>
			POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
		</p>
		<p>
			Though foreign donations are barred from federal elections, U.S. citizens and organizations that represent foreign interests in the U.S. may still contribute to candidates and campaigns. However, entities with foreign clients must report any campaign contributions they make to the Justice Department under FARA.
		</p>
		<p>
			 Note: Contribution amounts will likely NOT match records available at the Federal Election Commission, or those housed by the Sunlight Foundation's Influence Explorer and on OpenSecrets.org. The reason for this is that these contributions are self-reported by the registrant, while contribution records made available via the FEC are reported by political campaigns.  Because of the different reporting requirements, contribution dates are also not likely to match.		</p>
		<p>
			Nonetheless, FARA political donation information is valuable because it bypasses the painstaking name-matching process required when fusing campaign finance records and lobbying records for individuals and organizations that represent domestic clients and causes. The FARA records allow users to easily and reliably determine when someone from a lobbying or public relations organization is making campaign contribution to the same political offices that they are contacting on behalf of a foreign client-- a common practice highlighted by this data.)
		</p>
		<p>

			PAYMENTS
		</p>
		<p>
			These numbers tell you how much a foreign government, company or other entity is paying the firms or individuals representing it in the United States. The client field represents a payment on behalf of the client. (In rare cases, other entities foot the bill for services.) 
		</p>
		<p>
			DISBURSEMENTS
		</p>
		<p>
			These are expenses that the individual or organization incurs while representing a foreign government or entity.

	    Foreign Agent Registration Act Spreadsheet Guide
	</h3>
	<p>
	    This data is the hand-entered, structured and normalized version of the Foreign Agent Registrant Act (FARA) files found in PDF format at<a href="http://www.fara.gov/">
	    http://www.fara.gov/</a>. You may use Excel or any spreadsheet reader to open and read them, making it possible to easily search and analyze the information in
	    ways that the PDF format precludes.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Below is a brief description of the information included in the spreadsheets.
	</p>
	<p>
	    A few key definitions that will help you navigate these files:
	</p>
	<p>
	    The Foreign Agent also called, the Registrant, is the individual or organization enlisted to represent a foreign interest in the United States. These individuals or entities are sometimes,
	    but not always, lobbyists. They can also be public relations firms, tourism organizations or business associations, among other things.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Client is the foreign interest being represented. Sometimes foreign entities can represent themselves, which means the client and the lobbyist can be one
	    and the same.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Most dates are directly transcribed from FARA documents. Dates with an asterisk display the end date of the six-month reporting period because no date was
	    given for that item. If the month but no day was provided, the date is reported as the first day of the month. If a date range was reported the date is
	    represented as the first date of that range.
	</p>
	<h3>
	    CONTACTS:
	</h3>
	<p>
	    This data contains descriptions of lobbying contacts, press releases, meetings, conferences speeches and other activity reported in the FARA forms.
	</p>
	<p>
	    This is among the most valuable information that can be obtained via FARA because unlike lobbyists who represent domestic clients, representatives for
	    foreign interests must name lawmakers, staff members and even journalists whom they meet on behalf of their client.
	</p>
	<h4>
	    Explanation of Contact fields:
	</h4>
	<p>
	    'Date', the date of the contact
	</p>

	    'Client Location', the client's self-identified home base â€“ this not always an officially recognized state)
	</p>
	<p>
	    'Registrant', the person or organization that is filing, the foreign agent

	</p>
	<p>
	    'Affiliated Member CRP ID', This is the unique identifier issued to members of Congress by the Center for Responsive Politics and would be used to identify
	    contacts with that member as well as with his or her staff.
	</p>
	<p>

	<h3>
	    CONTRIBUTIONS
	</h3>
	<p>
	    Though foreign donations are barred from federal elections, U.S. citizens and organizations that represent foreign interests in the U.S. may still
	    contribute to candidates and campaigns. They must report these donations, however, to the Justice Department under FARA.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Note: These figures will NOT match records available at the Federal Election Commission, in Sunlight's Influence Explorer or Center for Responsive
	    Politics/Open Secrets. The reason: These contributions are self-reported by the registrant, while contribution records made available via the FEC are
	    reported by political campaigns. Because the FARA records have a different data source, the dates and amounts often will not match.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Nonetheless, FARA political donation information is valuable because it bypasses the painstaking name-matching process required when fusing, campaign
	    finance records and lobbying records for individuals and organizations that represent domestic clients and causes. The FARA records allow users to easily
	    and reliably determine when someone from a lobbying or public relations organization is making campaign donations to the same political offices that they
	    are contacting on behalf of a foreign client. (This is a common practice that is highlighted in this data.)
